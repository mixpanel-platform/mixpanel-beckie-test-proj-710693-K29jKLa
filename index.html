    <h1>Getting Started with Mixpanel</h1>
    
    <p> A comprehensive guide for kicking off your Mixpanel instance for new customers.</p>
    
<h6> Roles and Responsibilities </h6>
<p>In order to have a successful Mixpanel launch, you'll need to understand the different responsibilities and tasks needed before you have a tailored analytics instance for your business. Below are the tasks and roles that commonly assume each piece of the project.</p>

<!-- To do: I'd like for the following to be buttons / images of some sort - perhaps you can click and the text under of what the role is changes, or something like that. -->

<ul>
  <li>Product Manager: formalize scope of project (via spec), determine KPIs, provisioning access, learn Mixpanel core-reports</li>
  <li>Marketing: consult on spec (people!), articulate marketing needs, author notifications, learn (basic) Mixpanel reports, connect acquisition data (if available)</li>
  <li>Developer: implementing mixpanel (dev/prod), testing implementation (live view), accountable to implementation spec</li>
<li>Analyst (if applicable): learn core-mixpanel reports and capabilities</li>
<li>Executive (if applicable): approve implementation spec, articulate business/technology needs (beyond core analytics strategy), consult on spec</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h6>Understanding Events and People</h6>
<p>
Mixpanel has two fundamental spheres:
<ul>
  <li>Events: the things people do in your app</li>
	<li>People: the users who use your application</li>
</ul>
<br>
Both 'spheres' have properties which describe them (a 'sign up' can come from facebook; a 'user' can be 22 years old)
<br>
Everything that gets sent to Mixpanel is either an event, or a person, or a property underneath. Mixpanel can accept data from anywhere, but it must fit into one of these two paradigms. Therefore every product that uses Mixpanel to track its data needs to be adapted to fit into this model.

<br>
Mixpanel is the leading analytics platform because we allow users to close the loop on their analytics strategies. That is, you actively test your hypotheses and act on them directly within the platform. The two ways you can practice closed-loop analytics are:
<ul>
	<li>Notifications: to PEOPLE based on their properties</li>
	<li>A/B tests: to PEOPLE, also based on their properties</li>
</ul>

Closed loop analytics can only be practice based on the events, properties, and people attributes you have sent to Mixpanel.

<h6>Implementation Spec</h6>
An Implementation Spec is where you keep track of the events, people, and properties that you are sending to Mixpanel. It's essentially a project plan -- a document you can hand off to your developers to implement, as well as a reference guide for what you've implemented and what you'd like to add or remove in the future.

Here is an example of a very detailed spec for a standard customer in the 'Videos + Content' space. You'll see that they first identify their KPI's, build out their implementation plan based on events and properties as discussed above, and include links to Mixpanel's documentation to guide the developers: 

	https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kR5xO_lrpu6aPE9x3J6TJ5IKmKl5KBCccSisMhyYPJI/edit#gid=0
	
Here is a blank Implementation Spec for you to fill out, once you've identified your KPI's:



Some guidelines for customizing your own spec:

		DO create your own events
		DO add a ton of properties to better describe the events
		DO make it clear to the developer what values get filled in
		DO add platform-specific events (if flows are different on iOS & Android)
		

		DO NOT break the 'people prop', 'event prop' structure
		DO NOT implement Mixpanel before making a suitable implementation spec
		DO NOT using confusing, long, or obtuse event/property names
		DO NOT track EVERY single interaction in your app
		DO NOT only track 'page view' events

5. The Game Plan:

Provision Access (PM) => Finish Spec (PM & MKT) => Test implementation (dev) => Implement on production (dev)  ... => Data Review (PM & MKT)

(typical timeline 1-4 weeks, depending on resources)


6. Data review:

You can opt to have a data review in which a Mixpaneler will:
		- look over your implementation
		- make any recommendations (based on our knowledge of analytics)
		- help you build any core reports
		- train a broader audience on how to use Mixpanel
